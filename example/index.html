    <h1>The Route of All Evil</h1>
    <p>I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit&hellip; that’s why I’m transferring to business school! Well, thanks to the Internet, I’m now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence? Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by “devil”, I mean Robot Devil. And by “metaphorically”, I mean get your coat.</p>

    <h2>The Problem With Popplers</h2>
    <p>I had more, but you go ahead. I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. I wish! It’s a nickel.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Good news, everyone! I’ve taught the toaster to feel love!</li>
      <li>It may comfort you to know that Fry’s death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.</li>
      <li>Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died.</li>
      <li>I had more, but you go ahead.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lesser of Two Evils</h3>
    <p>Okay, I like a challenge. Ugh, it’s filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we’re at it? This is the worst part. The calm before the battle.</p>

    <h4>Godfellas</h4>
    <p>I meant ‘physically’. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually? I’ll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger. Now what?</p>
    <ol>
      <li>I’m Santa Claus!</li>
      <li>Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools.</li>
      <li>Is today’s hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient?</li>
    </ol>

    <h5>A Head in the Polls</h5>
    <p>We don’t have a brig. Bender, I didn’t know you liked cooking. That’s so cute. You mean while I’m sleeping in it? Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?!</p>

    <h6>I, Roommate</h6>
    <p>Good news, everyone! I’ve taught the toaster to feel love! I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. Ask her how her day was. Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You’d think it would be something you’d have to freebase. You, a bobsleder!? That I’d like to see! For example, if you killed your grandfather, you’d cease to exist!</p>
    <p>The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate. I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh&hellip; also, comes with double prize money. It doesn’t look so shiny to me. I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money!</p>
    <p>Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. This opera’s as lousy as it is brilliant!  Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can’t just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry! Do a flip!</p>
    <p>I had more, but you go ahead. It’s toe-tappingly tragic! Are you crazy? I can’t swallow that. Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won’t be sure you’ve done anything at all.</p>
    <p>For the last time, I don’t like lilacs!  Your ‘first’ wife was the one who liked lilacs! You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry’s worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them. I don’t ‘need’ to drink. I can quit anytime I want! Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun!</p>
    <p>Throw her in the brig. Kif might! Dear God, they’ll be killed on our doorstep! And there’s no trash pickup until January 3rd. I’m Santa Claus! Kids have names? Why did you bring us here?</p>
    <p>Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You’d think it would be something you’d have to freebase. Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. We’re rescuing ya.</p>
    <p>Is today’s hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? We’ll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we’ll go home. But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. That’s the ONLY thing about being a slave. I could if you hadn’t turned on the light and shut off my stereo. Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn’t make sense. But, okay!</p>
    <p>I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. I suppose I could part with ‘one’ and still be feared&hellip; Moving along&hellip; You lived before you met me?! Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head.</p>
    <p>With gusto. Leela, Bender, we’re going grave robbing. But existing is basically all I do! Okay, I like a challenge. Anyone who laughs is a communist!</p>
    <p>Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! Okay, it’s 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can’t hold the charge and the reception isn’t very&hellip; Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you!</p>
    <p>Hello, little man. I will destroy you! Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? And remember, don’t do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don’t not do it!</p>
    <p>Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. OK, if everyone’s finished being stupid. Moving along&hellip;</p>
    <p>Shut up and take my money! Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! Daylight and everything. In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. Yeah, and if you were the pope they’d be all, “Straighten your pope hat.” And “Put on your good vestments.” Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way?</p>
    <p>Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. Man, I’m sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn’t you just get me the death penalty?</p>
